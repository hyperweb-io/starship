# Bitcoin Chain Configuration in Starship

Starship now supports running a local Bitcoin network alongside Cosmos and Ethereum chains.
The configuration mirrors other chains and can be added in the `chains` section of your
Starship config file.

## Example Configuration
```yaml
chains:
  - id: bitcoin-local
    name: bitcoin
    numValidators: 1
    ports:
      rpc: 18443
      p2p: 18444
```

This will start a single `bitcoind` node in regtest mode exposing RPC on `18443` and
P2P on `18444` which you can port-forward to localhost.
